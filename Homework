Here's the basic HTML file we wrote:

<html>
  <head>
    <title>WebLab Playground</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Messing around with Functions!</h1>
    
    <script src="./functions.js"></script>
    
  </body>
</html>

And the initial JS file:

document.write('<h4>Word Count Example</h4>');

var wordCount = function(text) {
  // \W matches non-word characters, match one or more
  var tokens = text.split(/\W+/);
  // account for empty elements at the start or end of the list
  var count = tokens.length;
  if(tokens[0] === '') {
    count--;
  }
  if(tokens[tokens.length - 1] === '') {
    count--;
  }
  return count;
}

document.write('test 1: ' + wordCount(' one  two three'));
